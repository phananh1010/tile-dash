## Modify code
#### Modify the MP4Client source code
Modify the main.c in the following directory: gpac/applications/mp4client
The main entry function of Mp4Client starts from line #1131

Rebuild the .c file by navigating to the child directory, and execute `make` command. There must be a `Makefile` in that directory for the make to work

Run the MP4Client executable file using the following command:
```
./MP4Client http://localhost/dash/coaster2/coaster210x5.mpd
```

or 
```
gpac -gui http://localhost/dash/coaster2/coaster210x5.mpd -graph
```
In the command above, `-gui` parameter must be included to run in DASH mode. `-graph` parameter allows a graph structure showing chains of modules to be printed at the end of the execution.

#### Make a hello message to the client terminal screen
To show a message to the client terminal screen, use the following function:
```
fprintf(stderr, "message\n");
```


## Debug

#### Enable logging while calling MP4Client. 
use `-rti` and `-log-file` option to specify output file. Use `-logs` to specify log level and module to be logged.
For instance, checking log from all module:
```
MP4Client http://localhost/dash/coaster2/coaster210x5.mpd -rti rti.txt -log-file log.txt -logs "error@info"
```
Source for log option: https://helpmanual.io/help/MP4Client/

To debug with gdp, use this command to run the program and also load the test url:
```
gdb --args MP4Client http://localhost/dash/coaster2/coaster210x5.mpd
```

To debug and use mouse to switch viewport, use the following command instead:
```
gdb --args -gui MP4Client http://localhost/dash/coaster2/coaster210x5.mpd#VR
```

To debug with breakpoints in another files, use this command:
```
b <absolute_path>/gpac/src/media_tools/dash_client.c:4309
```
